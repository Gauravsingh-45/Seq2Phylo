# Seq2Phylo
Here we describe seq2phylo, a pipeline that is designed to construct phylogenetic tree directly by Whole Genome Sequencing reads. Seq2Phylo works by skipping the genome assembly and annotation step, and directly generating high-accuracy species-level trees using reference gene assemblies from across the genome.
